# Strava 70.3 Triathlon Training Analysis

The purpose of this project was to explore my 7 months of training leading up to both the 2021 IM 70.3 Ohio and 2022 IM 70.3 Benton Harbor triathlon. All training was recorded with an 
Apple Watch, Wahoo Kickr Snap indoor smart trainer, Zwift, and tracked with the Strava API to analyze all of my logged swim, outdoor and indoor bike, and run activities.
